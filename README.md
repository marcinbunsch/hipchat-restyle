Hipchat Restyle
===============

With version 2.5.5, Hipchat replaced its icon. I did not like it, so I decided to change it back to the previous one. Along the way I found a cool project which updates the Hipchat's visual style by Wells Riley. You can find it here: http://wells.ee/hipchat. I decided to keep the blue icon, though.

Usage
-----

This will work ONLY on OS X.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marcinbunsch/hipchat-restyle.git
cd hipchat-restyle
make
```

This will close Hipchat if it is running, replace files in Resources, then start Hipchat again.

The original Hipchat icon is taken from the previous Hipchat version.
